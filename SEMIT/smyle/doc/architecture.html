<h2>SMYLE: Architecture</h2>
  <img src="layers.gif">
  <p>
</p>

  Let's look at the different layers, starting from the bottom.
  <p>
</p>
  
  <h3>FileSystemDisk</h3>
  encapsulates access to the file system; is responsible for file naming, creation, access and deletion.
  Doesn't perform any caching.
  <p>
</p>
  
  Smyle employs a "throwaway" storage model. This means that the only operations that can be performed on
  files are Create and Delete. Put in another way: an existing file can not be modified.
  <p>
</p>
  
  How do write transactions work then? First, all data structures that have been changed are written to one
  or more new files. Finally, a special file called a <i>master file</i> is written. Master files can be
  distinguished from ordinary files by a leading "m" (m1234.smy). The new files and the master file will
  usually contain references to existing files (for those parts of the database that were left unchanged
  by the transaction).
  <p>
</p>
  
  Every write transaction increases the amount of garbage stored on disk since old files containing
  now-obsolete data are still around. Occasionally, Smyle performs a garbage collection to delete those
  files. Sometimes this involves copying quite some amount of data: If a file only partially contains
  garbage, the live parts must be saved to a new file before deletion of the original file.
  <p>
</p>
  
  The throwaway storage is one of the cornerstones of Smyle's very high reliability. At any given point
  in time, the file system contains a consistent database. The most recently written master file always
  determines the official database state. As long as a write transaction is being executed, the previous
  state remains the official one since no new master file has been written.
  <p>
</p>
  
  The last step of a write transaction, saving the master file, is the only disk operation that must be
  atomic - this is the moment where the switch between the old state and the new one occurs. The current
  implementation ensures atomicity by writing the master data to a temporary file and then renaming it to
  mXXX.smy. - Whether file renaming is actually atomic depends on the operating system. If you need absolute
  reliabilty, I recommend installing a journalling file system. (There are a number of free JFS
  available for Linux.)
  <p>
</p>
  
  <h3>Chunk Manager</h3>
  A chunk is an array of bytes; all persistent data structures in Smyle must be representable as (one or
  more) chunks. The chunk manager organizes chunks in files; this includes tasks such as merging multiple
  chunks into a single file, maintaining meta structures, garbage collection, and relocating chunks to
  improve data locality.
  <p>
</p>
  
  After a chunk has been stored by the chunk manager, it can be referenced by a 32-bit integer called
  the chunk index. Chunks are also handled in a "throwaway" fashion; they can only be created and disposed
  of, but not modified. Chunk index numbers can be reused, though.
  <p>
</p>
  
  The primary implementation, drjava.smyle.core.DefaultChunkManager, features a fairly sophisticated
  two-level meta structure hierarchy, in pursuit of a balance between access and update efficiency.
  The chunk manager also performs caching of raw file contents.
  <p>
</p>
  
  <h3>Table Data</h3>
  comprises schema description, the actual records and the element list - an array that holds
  the chunk index of every table row.
  <p>
</p>
  
  <h3>Index Data</h3>
  Smyle's index structure is an ordinary B-tree; augmented with special code to handle multiple index
  dimensions.
  <p>
</p>
  
  When I added indexing to Smyle, I found that the throwaway model doesn't suit a dynamic structure like
  a tree too well. The problem is that every node contains references to subnodes. When a node somewhere
  within the tree is changed, it is assigned a new chunk index. This induces a change in its parent node;
  that in turn needs a new chunk index too. This continues all the way to the root node and makes updates
  pretty inefficient.
  <p>
</p>
  
  So I created an intermediate structure, the <i>Handles</i>. Handles are basically a set of modifiable
  chunks, implemented in terms of regular, unmodifiable chunks. They also provide a caching mechanism for
  demarshalled objects and tracks whether they are are clean or dirty (changed, but not yet saved).
  I rewrote the B-tree implementation to use handles, and it became both cleaner and more efficient.
  <p>
</p>
  
  <h3>Generated Code</h3>
  Java sources/classes generated by drjava.smyle.CodeGenerator. Contain fields, accessor/mutator methods,
  marshalling/unmarshalling code, plus meta classes (filters, constructor classes).
  <p>
</p>
  
  <h3>Smyle API</h3>
  The public part of the Smyle code base (packages drjava.smyle and, in part, drjava.smyle.meta).
  Provides safe, high-level access to a Smyle store.
