<document title="Browser">
  The Smyle Browser is a Swing-based application to view the structure and definition
  of Smyle stores. It has been added in Smyle 0.8.1 and is currently fairly limited;
  it fails to display the contents of tables with a too complex structure.
  <p/>
  
  <h>Usage</h>
  First make sure you have smyle.jar in your classpath, then execute:
  
  <codeblock>
    java drjava.smyle.Browser
  </codeblock>
  
  This will open the browser's main window. Choose File/Open, go to your Smyle store
  directory and choose any of the .smy files. You should see something like this:
  <p/>
  
  <img src="browser.gif" />
  <p/>
  
  Just click on any of the tables to display its structure and contents.
