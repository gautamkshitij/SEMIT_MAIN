  <h>Who is using Smyle?</h>
  
  Smyle is successfully
  being used in production applications. Here are a few examples:
  
  <h>A Community System (Chat/Forum/Mail/Guestbook)</h>
  
  This is a web-based community system developed by the author of Smyle.
  Currently it is also the main application that drives the development
  of Smyle itself.
  <p/>
  
  The sources are not available yet, but I plan to include some of them in the
  Smyle distribution as a sample application.
  <p/>
  
  As the community server is upgraded to the latest development version
  of Smyle very often, you might expect that it's quite unstable.
  Surprisingly, this is not the case. The record so far:
  <p/>
  
  <ul>
    <li><em>Loss of data</em> - not once.</li>
    <li><em>Availability</em> - very high. The only db-related incident was a
      corrupted index structure caused by a pre-0.3 bug that prevented some of the users 
      from logging in.</li>
    <li><em>Performance</em> -  good. Typical page latency &lt;1s</li>
  </ul>
  
  Some more facts:

    <li>Rows per table: ~100-20,000</li>
    <li>Write transactions so far: &gt;300,000</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h>JImageDB</h>
  A system of applications that can package a categorized,
  keyword-searchable set of image files onto a CD.
  
  <ul>
    <li>Author: James Damour</li>
    <li>URL: <a href="http://jimagedb.sourceforge.net">http://jimagedb.sourceforge.net</a></li>
    <li>Smyle's role: provide the persistent data store for the categories and
keywords, and their relation to the image files</li>
    <li>Rows per table: up to a few thousand</li>
    <li>Technologies employed: Smyle, Servlets, Swing</li>
  </ul>
