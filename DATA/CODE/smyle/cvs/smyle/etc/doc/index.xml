  <h>What is Smyle?</h>
  
  Smyle is a database solution for Java applications.
  <p/>
  
  <h>Why should I care about Smyle?</h>
  
  You will care about Smyle if you are, as I am, frustrated by existing storage solutions.
  SQL has an awkward syntax and is poorly defined. All object oriented databases I've seen are
  either expensive or unusable (complicated or no schema evolution, poor query support).
  <p/>
  
  Smyle provides an innovative, pragmatic approach to data storage - easy to understand,
  convenient to use, but powerful enough for real world applications. And best of all, Smyle is open source and
  under the LGPL (that means, it's legal and free to use even in commercial applications).
