SMYLE - Storage that Makes Your Life Easier

SMYLE ROADMAP
-------------

(TE=test written, OK=done, BU=buggy, 80=scheduled for 0.8)
Feature codes: se=schema evolution, mp=multiple processes

 - limit accessSequence size
 - distil mailbox servlet example
 - find a way to report exceptions in flusher thread
 - compression
 - reverse() must be set per field
 - assert all table functions inform index advisor
 - assert all table functions use index
 - handle forgotten mutable snapshots (exception etc.)
   - do gc after a specified time
   - measure idle time (problem: change flag on entry/exit of every method)
 - new relocation detection (add chunk sizes and compare with file size)
 - can activeSnapshots vector overflow?
 - snapshot state after exception?
 - don't relocate small file if exactly one
OK struct cloning constructors
 - gc doesn't block read access
BU deferred commit
OK index on boolean
OK multidimensional indexes
 - se: lazy conversion?
 - 0.2 conversion with writer ids enabled: what happens if files already exist?
 - enable writer ids
 - sequence of boolean, long long
 - Snapshot.refresh
 - more complex filters (lessThan, greaterThan)
 - two-level and deeper nesting of f_... fields
 - additional table methods
 - multiple processes
 - multiple versions of Smyle classes in same VM (loaded by different classloaders)
 - XML export
 - admin servlet/application
 
new indexing system:
OK write PrefixKeySetTest
 - sorting over index
 - concatDimensions: assure fixed size for every part (needed for sorting)
 - add if-indexable tests where necessary (e.g. profile creation)
[- implement shortcuts]

For 0.9:
 - byte
 - float, double
 - sequence of boolean
 - sequence of byte
 - sequence of float, double
 - sequence of long long
 - rename long long to long, long to int?
