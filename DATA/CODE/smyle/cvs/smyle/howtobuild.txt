HOW TO BUILD SMYLE
------------------
Stefan Reich (doc@drjava.de)


1. Make sure you have a JDK 1.2 or higher installed

2. If you haven't done so, set the variable JAVA_HOME to the base directory of
   your JDK. To do this, type something like
   
     export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.3   on Unix or
     set JAVA_HOME=c:\jdk1.3             on Windows
     
3. cd to the Smyle base directory
     
3. All the libraries and compilers that Smyle needs to be built are included
   in this distribution, so you don't need to install or configure anything
   else (besides the JDK). Cool, huh?
   
   So now you just start the build:

     bin/ant      on Unix or
     bin\ant      on Windows
     
   ...and you're done!
   
   If the last line on the screen says "BUILD SUCCESSFUL", you now have the
   following:
   
     -a binary package of Smyle in build/smyle.jar, ready for inclusion in
      your projects
     -(rudimentary) documentation in doc/api
