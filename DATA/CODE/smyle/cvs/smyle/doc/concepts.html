<h2>SMYLE: Concepts</h2>
  <h3>Snapshots</h3>
  
  With Smyle, whenever you work on the data in a store, you actually work on a <i>snapshot</i>.
  Concept-wise, a Smyle snapshot is just the same as a holiday snapshot: a frozen image of how
  the world looked like in a certain moment (the moment when you took the snapshot).
  <p>
</p>
  
  Snapshots have a number of pleasant qualities:
  <ul>
  <li>You can keep them as long as you want.
  <p>
</p>
</li>
  <li>The contents of a snapshot is always consistent. Modifications made to the store by other
      writers will either be completely visible in the snapshot, or not at all.
  <p>
</p>
</li>
  <li>Taking a snapshot is an almost free operation in terms of time and memory consumption.<br>
  <p>
</p>
</li>
  </ul>

  Smyle distinguishes between immutable and mutable snapshots. The former can only be used to 
  request data from the database, while the latter also allow adding, updating or deleting.
  <p>
</p>
  Immutable snapshots are fool-proof: You can create any number of them; you don't need to
  explicitly release them (they are garbage collected automatically); and they always throw an
  exception if you try to execute any modifying operations.
  <p>
</p>
  Mutable snapshots, on the other hand, require a bit more care. At any given time, at most one
  mutable snapshot per store may exist. This means to the programmer:

  <ul>
  <li>You have to make sure that you release the snapshot properly; either by committing it or by
    forgetting it (undo all changes and release snapshot). This can be accomplished by
    using a <i>finally</i> phrase (see <a href="idioms.html">Smyle idioms</a>).
  <p>
</p>
</li>
  <li>After you created the snapshot, you should try to get your work done as quickly as possible.
    Try to gather all the data you need in advance. Never do any potentially blocking operations
    (remote queries, user interaction, ...) while you hold a mutable snapshot.
  <p>
</p>
</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Lock-Free Read Access</h3>
  
  This means: You never have to wait for any locks if you make and work on an immutable snapshot.
  <p>
</p>
  
  This can be essential for realtime or near-realtime applications. You could imagine an MP3
  jukebox based on Smyle. Many clients stream MP3s right out of a huge Smyle
  store. You can then do long-running transactions on the store (add new files, re-encode
  existing files at a different bit rate, ...) without interrupting any of the streams -
  even if some of them are playing the files you are working on. (Provided
  your server can generally handle the load, of course.)
  <p>
</p>

  The current implementation is semi-lock-free. For performance reasons, snapshots share common
  data structures, which requires some synchronisation and forces parallel request into a serial
  execution order. The general idea is preserved, though: locks are only held for the duration of
  a single command; there is no way to lock out (reading) clients indefinitely by executing many
  commands in a single transaction.
