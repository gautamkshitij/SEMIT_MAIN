ChunkManager Design Questions
-----------------------------

* Handles+central chunk table rather than direct references?

  Handles:
  + chunk refs fit into 32 bit
  - table takes up space (64+32+32 bit per chunk, file/offset/length)
  - creating a chunk involves an additional (collapsable) write to chunk table
  Direct refs:
  - more than one pointer may need to be changed when moving a chunk (which happens often)
  - snapshot/table classes need code to update chunk pointers; can easily be inefficient too
    (has to scan large FileRef tables)
  - chunk refs might not even fit into 64 bit
  
  ==> Result of evaluation: Handles are the way to go!
